# Pandas
Pandas is a Python module, and Python is the programming language that we're going to use. The Pandas module is a high performance, highly efficient, and high level data analysis library.  At its core, it is very much like operating a headless version of a spreadsheet, like Excel. Most of the datasets you work with will be what are called dataframes. You may be familiar with this term already, it is used across other languages, but, if not, a dataframe is most often just like a spreadsheet. Columns and rows, that's all there is to it! From here, we can utilize Pandas to perform operations on our data sets at lightning speeds.
